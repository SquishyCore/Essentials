# SquishyCore Essentials Fork

## What's changed?
- Added a "who can modify whose inventory" feature for the `/invsee` command through the `essentials.invsee.canModify.[group name]` permission node.
- Made the `sethome-multiple` limits accumulate instead of being overridden by the permission/group with the highest weight.
